# sprites-tweenmax-animation
Sprites animation using TweenMax.
The main proposal of this repository is the undestanding how to make a simple sprite animation using GSAP TweenMAx.

#First of all we need a horizontal or vertical sprite image for made the movement.
I recommed use horizontal sprite because is lighter than vertical sprite.
